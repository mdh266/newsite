  About Me
  
    
    Link to heading
  


I&rsquo;m a AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist based in New York City, with 10 years of experience solving complex business and technical problems through data. I specialize in end-to-end development of scalable machine learning solutions, and have worked on and led cross-functional teams with projects spanning supervised/unsupervised learning, AutoML, optimization, entity resolution, natural language processing, geospatial analysis, econometrics, marketing analytics and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).


Since 2017, I’ve been working extensively with Apache Spark in both Python and Scala, building high-performance data pipelines and distributed systems, leading to two patents. More recently, I’ve been focused on building applications powered by GenAI and large language models (LLMs), with a strong interest in LangChain and LangGraph frameworks. I lead with a blend of hands-on technical skill and strategic vision—driven by a passion for technology, a commitment to team growth, and a focus on solving complex problems with real-world impact.


With a PhD in Computational Applied Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin I have a strong background in both quantitative methods and scientific software engineering. My focus during graduate school was on researching discontinuous Galerkin methods and finite element methods for simulating photo-electrochemical solar cells which led me to contribute multiple times to the open source finite element library, deal.ii.


In my free time, I proudly serve in the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, the uniformed volunteer component of the United States Coast Guard.


In another life, I was a competitive athlete and coach in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for over 17 years. During my career I trained with and competed against the best fighters all over the world. In 2012, I won the World Championships and in 2015 achieved the rank of 1st degree Black Belt from 2x Pan American Champion Professor Dave Ginsberg. I also had the privlage of coaching hundreds of students and I am proud to have created local, national and world champions. Despite having to stop training, I am grateful for the all experiences and to have had an amazing coach along with great mentors, sponsors, friends, teammates and students.">
